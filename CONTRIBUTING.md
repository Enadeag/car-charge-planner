The rest of this guide (reporting problems, code style, the pull request routine) is still to be written.
For now it covers one thing people ask first: translating the app.

## Adding a language

Every text the app shows is translatable, and a language is one file. You need the project set up as in the
README, plus Babel (`pip install babel`). Run the commands from the project root.

1. **Start the file.** Use the language code, `nl` for Dutch, `pt_BR` for Brazilian Portuguese:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m car_charge_planner.i18n_tools init nl
   ```

   This creates `src/car_charge_planner/locale/nl/LC_MESSAGES/car-charge-planner.po`, a copy of the template with every text
   waiting for a translation.

2. **Translate.** Open the `.po` file in a translation editor (Poedit, Lokalize, Gtranslator) or a text editor.
   Things to know:
   - `{name}` placeholders (`{pct}`, `{end}`, `{n}`) are filled in by the app. Keep them exactly as written, but
     put them wherever your language wants them: word order is yours.
   - Texts with a number have one form per plural your language has (`{n} day` / `{n} days`).
   - A text with a context line (`msgctxt`) is the same English word in a different role. `weekday, short` is
     "Mon", `month, short` is "Jan"; write them the way your language abbreviates them.
   - `decimal separator` is the one place to write `,` if your language writes 1,6 instead of 1.6.
   - `list separator` is what goes between items of a list (`, `).
   - A text you leave empty stays English.

3. **Compile and try it.**

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m car_charge_planner.i18n_tools compile
   LANGUAGE=nl .venv/bin/car-charge-planner
   ```

   The app follows `LANGUAGE`, then `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES` and `LANG`. Once at least one translation is installed,
   Settings, on the Interface tab, shows a Language choice; it applies the next time the app starts.

4. **Check it.** The tests find the usual mistakes (a text that is still English, a label that no longer fits):

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/pytest -q tests/test_i18n.py tests/test_i18n_texts.py tests/test_pseudo_language.py tests/test_language_setting.py
   ```

   Look at the Settings tabs and the popup in your language: long words are the usual trouble.

5. **Send it.** Commit the `.po` file of your language and open a pull request. The compiled `.mo` files are not committed: they are built from the `.po` files when the app is packaged, and you make them yourself (step 3) to try a language from a clone.

### When the English texts change

`python -m car_charge_planner.i18n_tools extract` rewrites the template from the code, and `python -m car_charge_planner.i18n_tools update` merges
it into every language's `.po`; new and changed texts show up untranslated (or marked fuzzy: check those). A test
fails when the committed template is behind the code, so a text added to the code comes with a refreshed template.
